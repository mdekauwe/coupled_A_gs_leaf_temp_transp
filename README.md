# Solve coupled C<sub>i</sub>, g<sub>s</sub>, E, A<sub>n</sub> and T<sub>leaf</sub>.

## Overview ##
Iteratively solve the intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (Ci), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E), net leaf assimilation (An) and leaf temperature (Tleaf).

Code follows the same logic as MAESTRA, though it departs in a few places where I've felt the need to simplfy.
