# Solve coupled Ci, gs, E, An and Tleaf.

## Overview ##
Iteratively solve the intercellular CO$_2$ concentration (Ci), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E), net leaf assimilation (An) and leaf temperature (Tleaf).

Code follows the same logic as MAESTRA, though it departs in a few places where I've felt the need to simplfy.
