# Solve coupled $C_i$, $g_s$, $E$, $A_n$ and $T_{leaf}$.

## Overview ##
Iteratively solve the intercellular CO$_2$ concentration ($C_i$), stomatal conductance ($g_s$), transpiration ($E$), net leaf assimilation ($A_n$) and leaf temperature $T_{leaf}$.

Code follows the same logic as MAESTRA, though it departs in a few places where I've felt the need to simplfy.
